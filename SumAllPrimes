Sum all the prime numbers up to and including the provided number.

A prime number is defined as a number greater than one and having only two divisors, one and itself. For example, 2 is a prime number because it's only divisible by one and two.

The provided number may not be a prime.

Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck. Try to pair program. Write your own code.

code:

function sumPrimes(num) {
  if (num < 2) { 
    return 0;
  }
 
  var ans = 2; 
  for (var i = 3; i <= num; i += 2) {
    if (isPrime(i)) {
      ans += i;
    }
  }
 
  return ans;
 
  function isPrime(num) {
    if (num <= 1) {
      return false;
    }
    for (var i = 2; i <= num / 2; i++) {
      if (num % i === 0) {
        return false;
      }
    }
    return true;
  }
